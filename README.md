# Fake-News-detection

This project aims to detect fake news articles using a machine learning approach. By leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, the model classifies news articles as either real or fake based on textual data. This solution is designed to address the increasing spread of misinformation in the digital age.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

- **Feature Extraction:** Using TF-IDF vectorization to transform textual data into numerical form.

- **Machine Learning Model:** Employing the Random Forest classifier for robust and accurate classification.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains labeled news articles with "real" and "fake" classifications.

You can use publicly available datasets like the Fake News Dataset or any similar dataset. Ensure the data is preprocessed before feeding it into the model.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing:

- Handle bias in the dataset by ensuring balanced representation of "real" and "fake" news categories, possibly through techniques like undersampling.

### 2. Feature Extraction:

- Use TF-IDF vectorizer to convert textual data into numerical features.

### 3. Model Training:

- Train a Random Forest classifier on the processed dataset.

### 4. Prediction:

- Use the trained model to classify new articles as "real" or "fake."

### 5. Web Application:

- The web application allows users to input a news article and receive a real-time classification result.

## Limitations

- The model’s accuracy depends on the quality and diversity of the training dataset.

- Limited ability to detect nuanced fake news or context-based misinformation

## Future Improvements

- Experimenting with deep learning models like LSTMs or transformers.

- Incorporating metadata (e.g., source credibility, publication date) for enhanced classification.

- Expanding the dataset with more diverse and multilingual articles.

## Tools and Libraries

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

- scikit-learn

- Flask (for web application development)

- HTML, CSS (for building the web interface)
